I'm a lifelong builder and consumer of internet-powered things. The software I've designed and built has been seen and touched by tens (if not hundreds) of millions of people as they've engaged with brands like Facebook, FIFA, Ubisoft, RCA Records, and the International Olympic Committee.

## :dart: Darts

I found a love for the darts in 2014 and have been obsessed with the sport ever since. I'm always building [Darts Atlas](https://www.dartsatlas.com), a technology platform that makes it easy to play, organize, and find casual or organized matches. Darts Atlas is the technology behind my community-building efforts through [City League Darts](https://www.cityleaguedarts.com) and [Junior League Darts](https://www.juniorleaguedarts.com).

## :office: City of Austin

I help manage the web presence and infrastructure for the Austin Convention Center Department. In addition to the public websites, there are a number of internal and public-facing web experiences that help staff and clients run their events as effectively as possible. An overview of the web infrastructure can be found at [webguides.austinconventioncenter.com](https://webguides.austinconventioncenter.com).
